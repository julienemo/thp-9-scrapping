THP day 9 - Scraping
travail d'Arthur Klein (slack @Arthur Klein) Julie Kwok (slack @Julie Kowk)

what we could have made the programme more user friendly with a perform method that provides user choice
but you image yesterday.....we are quite proud of what we have already done
thank you for your time and advice

so we still don't have the perform func up to now, for none of the 3 projects ><

projet 00 returns the list of currency-price hashes
projet 01 and 02 have the same logic
they both have 3 functions:first one scraps the individual info on one page, second gets the links to scrap, the third and last combines the two and scraps all the links obtained by the second func

project 00 doesn't take any argument, it just goes to the one site that we hard wrote

we are proud to say that 01 can take annuaire website of any French department

project 02 takes either the list page or any personal info page of assemblee nationale deputies

the arguments are commented at the end of each prog
