THP day 9 - Scraping
travail d'Arthur Klein (slack @Arthur Klein) Julie Kwok (slack @Julie Kowk)

what we could have made the programme more user friendly with a perform method that provides user choice
but you image yesterday.....we are quite proud of what we have already done
thank you for your time and advice

so we still don't have the perform func up to now ><
